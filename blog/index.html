                        But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those. I just want to say thanks. Good luck.

                    <p>Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright? Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here! Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first.</p>

                    <p>Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was? Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police! WOO! Alright!</p>

                    <p>Oh no no no. I'll be fine. Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. Oh, god, this again? You’re Stinky.</p>
                    
                   <p> Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven. Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.
