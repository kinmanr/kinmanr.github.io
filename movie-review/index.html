           <h3> Plot:</h3>
            <p> "This is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York,” Ben Horne whispered, his eyes fixed on the flickering home movies projected before him. The room smelled of pine and secrets, and the air hummed with unseen forces. He reached out, almost touching the ethereal image of his mother, her face frozen in time.</p>
            <h3>My Review:</h3>
            <p>
                The owls were not what they seemed. Ben knew this, just as he knew that the town held secrets buried deep within its mist-shrouded forests. The Bookhouse Boys whispered of ancient texts, hidden passages, and forbidden knowledge. And now, as the projector whirred, he found himself reciting lines from Shakespeare’s Richard III, the words both a lament and a revelation.
                “Leland, the time has come for you to seek the path,” Special Agent Dale Cooper intoned, his voice steady yet tinged with sorrow. Leland Palmer, his soul adrift in the liminal space between worlds, listened. The room pulsed with unseen energy, and the flickering light cast shadows on the Tibetan prayer flags hanging by the window.
                “Your soul has set you face-to-face with the clear light,” Cooper continued, his eyes reflecting the otherworldly glow. “Find the light, Leland. Abide in that state.” The words echoed through the room, merging with the crackling film reel. Leland’s eyes widened, glimpsing the void and the cloudless sky beyond.
                Lucy, ever curious, had started reading about Tibet. She wondered if the Bookhouse Boys knew about the ancient texts, the Bardo states, and the thin places where reality blurred. Perhaps the owls held the answers—they were messengers, after all. Or maybe it was the Log Lady, her log whispering secrets only she could hear.
                And so, in this strange fusion of worlds, Lorem Ipsum danced with Tibetan wisdom, and the owls watched from the branches. The Bookhouse Boys decoded hidden messages, and the Black Lodge stirred in its slumber. The Log Lady smiled knowingly, her eyes reflecting the stars. Jade gives two rides.
